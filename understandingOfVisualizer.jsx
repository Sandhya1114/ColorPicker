/*Input Handling: The user inputs a palette of colors, which can be done through color pickers, text fields, or drag-and-drop functionality.

Color Representation: The colors are often represented in a format like RGB (Red, Green, Blue) or HEX (e.g., #FF5733).

Rendering: The visualizer uses a graphical interface (often built with HTML/CSS and JavaScript) to render the colors. Each color in the palette is displayed as a swatch or block.

Interactivity: Users can interact with the palette, such as rearranging colors, adding new colors, or removing existing ones. The visualizer updates in real-time to reflect these changes.

Color Theory: Some visualizers may also include features that analyze the color combinations based on color theory principles (like complementary colors, analogous colors, etc.) and suggest adjustments or variations.Use high-resolution images to start with, as they can withstand some degree of compression and resizing.
Check if the tool allows you to adjust settings related to image quality or compression.
If possible, upload images in a lossless format (like PNG) to preserve quality during processing.

/**
 * Extract Colors from the Image:

Analyze the image to identify the original color you want to replace. This can be done using color quantization techniques.
Select Original and New Colors:

Allow the user to select the original color from the extracted colors.
Allow the user to choose a new color that will replace the original color.
Determine Color Shades:

For each pixel in the image, check if it matches the original color or is a lighter/darker shade of that color.
--You can use a color distance formula (like Euclidean distance in RGB space) to determine --if a pixel is similar to the original color.
Calculate Corresponding Shades:

For each pixel that matches the original color or its shades, calculate the lightness or darkness of that pixel.
--Replace it with a corresponding shade of the new color. This means if the original pixel is lighter, you will use a lighter version of the new color, and if it is darker, you will use a darker version of the new color.
Update the Image:

After processing all the pixels, update the image to reflect the changes.
 


---replace an original color in an image with a new color, ensuring that any lighter or darker shades of the original color are replaced with corresponding lighter or darker shades of the new color.
